# Pull requests are welcome. 

Please feel free to correct any errors or omissions I may have made.

## I will keep these goals in mind when considering a pull request:

1. Make this easy for people to understand.
2. Keep it short enough to cover in a 1 hour presentation.
3. Provide some accessible notes for people to use as a reference.
4. Learn some Python!
